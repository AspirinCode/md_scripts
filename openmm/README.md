#OpenMM python scripts

This folder contains a set of Python scripts that interface with OpenMM
to perform several steps of preparing and running MD simulations.

Work in progress:
- Membrane simulations (isotropic pressure coupling only for now)
- Proper triclinic simulation boxes. After minimization box vectors get funny.
